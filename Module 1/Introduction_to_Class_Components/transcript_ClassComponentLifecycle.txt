Welcome to the Class
Component Lifecycle. After watching this video, you will be able to explain
a component's lifecycle, describe each phase, and list
methods used in each phase. React class components
have lifecycles, meaning they go through three
phases over their lifetime. During each phase, React provides lifecycle
methods you can access. A component's lifecycle
has three main phases. These phases include mounting,
updating, and unmounting. In the mounting phase, you instantiate the object using the component class constructor and assign it a default state. In the update phase, the states and props of a component change
due to user events. Changes can also occur within the component due to a
change in the back end. The component re-renders
in this phase. Finally, there's unmounting. As the name suggests, the component is
removed from the page. The component
lifecycle refers to the component's
relationship with the DOM. The component
lifecycle starts when components are created
and mounted on the DOM. Once mounted, React updates the DOM according to
the component logic. Then the components die when the system unmounts
them from the DOM. React automatically calls
the responsible method according to its phase. Although React automatically
invokes these methods, you can manipulate them to gain more control over
component behavior. Two of the methods used
when the component mounts include componentWillMount
and componentDidMount. The render method is also
called for the first time. The system invokes the
componentWillMount method prior to the first execution
of the render function. The system invokes the
componentDidMount method right after the render function executes for the first time. Methods specific to
the update phase include
getDerivedStateFromProps, getSnapshotBeforeUpdate,
and componentDidUpdate. You use the
getDerivedStateFromProps method if you have updated props and want to reflect that in
the component state. Another method,
getSnapshotBeforeUpdate gives you access to the component's previous props and
state before updating. The last method invoked in this phase is
componentDidUpdate. This method allows you
to create side effects, such as sending
network requests or calling the
this.SetState method. You will also call
the render method, but this method does not exclusively belong
to this phase. The render method in this phase updates the
component in the UI. The unmounting phase has only one lifecycle method,
componentWillUnmount. The system invokes this function before removing the
component from the page, denoting the end
of its lifecycle. This method performs
necessary cleanup such as canceling network requests
or removing listeners. In this video, you learned that a component's lifecycle refers to its relationship
with the DOM. The three phases
in the lifecycle include mount,
update, and unmount. In the mount phase, the methods include componentWillMount
and componentDidMount. Methods invoked during
the update phase include
getDerivedStateFromProps, getSnapshotBeforeUpdate,
and componentDidUpdate. In the final unmount phase, React calls the
componentWillUnmount method. The render method is called in both the mount and
update phases.
